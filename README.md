# angular-oauth20-seed — the seed for AngularJS apps with OAuth2.0 sign-in support

This project is an application skeleton for a typical [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) web app.
You can use it to quickly bootstrap your angular webapp projects and dev environment for these
projects.

This is for those who need the implementation of a light-weight sign-in functionality. Thus a
social provider, such as Google or Facebook, can help you to provide this requirement with no major
effort by letting you to put focus in the core of your business. Here you'll working some concepts of the
[OAuth2.0 RFC](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749), thus this app follows the [implicit grant](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.2) flow
as being a client-side only app. At the moment of writing, this app support sign-in user with Google,
for more information about how this Identity provider, IDP support this functionality can be find [here](https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2UserAgent).

The seed contains AngularJS libraries, test libraries and a bunch of scripts all preconfigured for
instant web development gratification. Just clone the repo (or download the zip/tarball), start up
our (or yours) webserver and you are ready to develop and test your application.

The seed app doesn't do much, just shows how to wire two controllers and views together. You can
check it out by opening app/index.html in your browser (might not work file `file://` scheme in
certain browsers, see note below).

_Note: While angular is client-side-only technology and it's possible to create angular webapps that
don't require a backend server at all, we recommend hosting the project files using a local
webserver during development to avoid issues with security restrictions (sandbox) in browsers. The
sandbox implementation varies between browsers, but quite often prevents things like cookies, xhr,
etc to function properly when an html page is opened via `file://` scheme instead of `http://`._


## How to use angular-oauth20-seed

Clone the angular-oauth20-seed repository and start hacking...


### Running the app during development

You can pick one of these options:

* serve this repository with your webserver
* install node.js and run `scripts/web-server.js`

Then navigate your browser to `http://localhost:<port>/app/index.html` to see the app running in
your browser.

#### Configuring the app

For running this app and interacting with Google, you'll need to go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://cloud.google.com/console)
and registering there a new application. There are two required steps you need to perform here:
* register a redirect URI, in this case: `http://localhost:<port>/app/dashboard.html`
* grab the google client id assigned to your app and replace the string `YOUR_GOOGLE_OAUTH20_CLIENT_ID` located `app/configurations.js` with this


### Running the app in production

This really depends on how complex is your app and the overall infrastructure of your system, but
the general rule is that all you need in production are all the files under the `app/` directory.
Everything else should be omitted.

Angular apps are really just a bunch of static html, css and js files that just need to be hosted
somewhere, where they can be accessed by browsers.

If your Angular app is talking to the backend server via xhr or other means, you need to figure
out what is the best way to host the static files to comply with the same origin policy if
applicable. Usually this is done by hosting the files by the backend server or through
reverse-proxying the backend server(s) and a webserver(s).


### Running unit tests

We recommend using [jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/) and
[Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io) for your unit tests/specs, but you are free
to use whatever works for you.

Requires [node.js](http://nodejs.org/), Karma (`sudo npm install -g karma`) and a local
or remote browser.

* start `scripts/test.sh` (on windows: `scripts\test.bat`)
  * a browser will start and connect to the Karma server (Chrome is default browser, others can be captured by loading the same url as the one in Chrome or by changing the `config/karma.conf.js` file)
* to run or re-run tests just change any of your source or test javascript files


### End to end testing

We recommend using [protractor](https://github.com/angular/protractor) for end-to-end tests. It
uses native events and has special features for Angular applications.

Requires a webserver, node.js + `./scripts/web-server.js` or your backend server that hosts the angular static files.

* create your end-to-end tests in `test/e2e/scenarios.js`
* serve your project directory with your http/backend server or node.js + `scripts/web-server.js`
* to run:
  * run the tests from console with [Protractor](https://github.com/angular/protractor) via
    `scripts/e2e-test.sh` (on windows: `scripts\e2e-test.bat`)
